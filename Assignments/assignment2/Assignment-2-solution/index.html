			<p id="three" class="heading">Fish</p>
			<p> Fish are usually low in fat and high in omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 improves mental functions and helps in maintaining a healthy heart by lowering blood pressure. Researchers have discovered that eating fish regularly may reduce the risk of diseases ranging from asthma to prostate cancer. White fish like cod are a great source of low fat proteins while oily fish like sardines, salmon and mackerel are dense with omega-3 acids</p>
